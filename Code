To start the script:
./start_script.sh

Get the data into HDFS
$hdfs dfs -mkdir /rawdata

Now put the required files at the particular available location to the created directory (rawdata)
$hdfs dfs -put Desktop/listings.csv/rawdata

how let us launch the hive
type hive in the terminal
now hive is activated

let us create a database using hive
>create database Database_One with dbproperties("created_by"="Sai Vamshi", "purpose"="Project");

Now let us call the database properties
>desc database extended Database_One;

Now let us use the created database to create tables and run the complex queries
>use database Database_One;
>create table listings_Two (id string, name string, host_id int, host_name string, neighbourhood_group int, 
                       neighbourhood int, latitude float, longitude float, room_type string, price float, 
                       minimum_nights int, number_of_reviews int, last_review date, reviews_per_month int, 
                       calculated_host_listings_count int,availability_365 int, number_of_reviews_ltm int, 
                       license int) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde'WITH SERDEPROPERTIES("separatorChar" = ",","quoteChar"= "\"");

Now let us import the data available in the csv file to the listings table
>load data inpath '/rawdata/Desktop/listings.csv' into table listings_Two;

#Now let us create some questions and write queries to solve those questions.

1. Assuming the number of reviews implies popularity, write a query that can find what the 
   Top 10 most popular neighborhoods are in your location by number of reviews? 
   (Take a screenshot of your query and the results)

2. The total number of reviews might imply popularity but not recency, write a query that can find the name of the 10 hosts 
   who have the most recent reviews at your location? (Take a screenshot of your results)  

3. Validate that the two files were pulled at the same time and calculate the total number of reviews per host on the reviews table and 
   compare it to the total number_of_reviews on the listing table? Compare the top 10 hosts for your location. 

4. Write your own question to the Airbnb database that a business analyst might be ask to give an answer to their CEO. This could be about listings under one host, 
   characteristics of listings in relationship to price, neighbourhood characteristics, etc. 
   This can be a simple business research question with a straightforward answer but it should be an original question.
