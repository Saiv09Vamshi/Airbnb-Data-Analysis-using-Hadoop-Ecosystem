Project Title

Airbnb Data Analysis using Hadoop Ecosystem

Description

This project involves the ingestion and analysis of Airbnb data using the Hadoop ecosystem, specifically focusing on HDFS, Hive, and Impala. The objective is to demonstrate the capabilities of Hadoop for processing large datasets and generating insights comparable to traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS).

Technologies Used

HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System for storing large datasets.
Hive: Data warehouse infrastructure for providing data summarization and ad-hoc querying.
Impala: Fast, interactive SQL query engine for Hadoop.
Sqoop: Tool for transferring data between Hadoop and relational databases.
Hue: Web interface for interacting with Hadoop services.
SQL: Query language used for data analysis.
Excel: Used for initial data cleaning and preparation.
Linux: Operating system for running Hadoop commands and scripts.
Dataset

Source: Inside Airbnb (link to dataset)
Files:
listings.csv: Contains data about the Airbnb listings.
reviews.csv: Contains data about the reviews for each listing.

The purpose of this project is to:

Demonstrate Data Ingestion and Processing: To showcase the ability to ingest structured data from CSV files into Hadoop's HDFS and transform it for analysis using Hive and Impala.
Leverage Hadoop's Scalability: To highlight how the Hadoop ecosystem can handle large datasets, offering scalability and flexibility compared to traditional RDBMS.
Generate Business Insights: To analyze Airbnb listings and reviews to uncover insights about popularity, host performance, and neighborhood characteristics, which can aid business decision-making.
Implement SQL Queries in Big Data Context: To practice writing and executing SQL queries in Hive and Impala, demonstrating the ability to perform complex data analyses in a big data environment.
Validate Data Consistency: To ensure data integrity by comparing data across multiple tables, confirming that data was accurately ingested and processed.
Support Real-World Applications: To prepare the groundwork for real-world applications in business analytics by addressing relevant business questions that could impact decision-making for stakeholders.
This project serves as both a technical exercise and a practical application of data analysis skills in the context of real-world datasets.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of the Hadoop ecosystem in processing large datasets and generating actionable insights from Airbnb data, offering an alternative to traditional database systems.
